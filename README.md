# Selectable Meeting Room
It's a part of an intranet project for employees, and it aims to organize the meeting rooms reservation.  

# What's new?
1- The user can select the start time of the meeting and then drag to the end time of the meeting with css classes added.  
2- If the user mistooke the wrong room, he can easily hover on the right column and ALL the selecting will go after him.  
3- Conscious whether the room is available or not between the start time and the end time.
